## Technologies Used

The landing page was built using the following technologies:

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Sass
- Bootstrap 5
- Vanilla JavaScript
- Node.js
- NPM
- AI (GPT-3.5, Fliki)

## Project Overview

The Exolink Landing Page project is a demonstration of my web development techniques and showcases the use of various technologies. Although the landing page is for a fictional company, Exolink, the primary focus of this project is to highlight the implementation of the landing page itself rather than the company.

The landing page features a visually appealing design with fluid animations, a carefully curated color palette, and animated images to create an engaging user experience. It also utilizes the power of AI through ChatGPT,
for generating descriptive content, and Fliki.ai, an AI model used for generating voice-over videos.

To provide an immersive experience, I have created a fake promotional video for Exolink using Fliki.ai. You can access this video by clicking the "Get to know us" button when you load the page.
